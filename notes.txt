TODO:
- what if an object falls within another object and becomes hidden and can't be selected?
	- be able to hide/show objects
- movement is still a bit buggy -> movement is dependent on axes, which is affected by rotation
	- base movement on object's forward vector? (e.g. use forward vector to determine which way along axis to move)
- modify trackball (can we lock/restrict axis for movement?). it's kinda annoying as it is currently.
- be able to adjust lighting properties other than position (e.g. color as well)
- explore different shaders
- get shadows working
- improve scaling ux (be able to specify a value, not just have a slider)
- be able to change visibility of objects in scene
- be able to apply image texture to walls
- objects that have multiple meshes should be grouped into one object (e.g. vending machine)

todo models:
- wall shelves
- wall hooks for clothes
- keyboard
- instruments (e.g. trumpet, guitar)
- ceiling fan
- more chair options
- rug
